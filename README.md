# Iris-Classifier
An Iris classifier is a machine learning model that classifies iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. It uses the Iris dataset, which has four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Algorithms like KNN or SVM train on this data to predict the species based on these measurements.

# Procedure
* Download your dataset.
* Replace you dataset path.
* Run, Visualize and Predict the Species of Iris.
